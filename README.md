### This is an brief biography of Zhaodi Chen

My name is Zhaodi Chen, but if you have difficulties in pronouncing it, you can call me _Judy_. I was born in **China** in 1995. As an undergraduate, I majored in **Sociology** in _Sun Yat-sen University_.

I have called the following places _home_:
1. Zhuhai
1. Guangzhou
1. Chicago

_Few people know that I **hate eating carrots**_

One of my addictions is playing Mahjong, which is a traditional game in China.
Here is an image of Mahjong:
